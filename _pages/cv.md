 * Central Judicial Inspector: Establishment of Circuit Tribunals and Corporate Innovation in China
   * Abstract: Optimizing the allocation of judicial resources to cover the demand of growing economic de-
velopment contradictions has been a critical step for China’s justice reform. We evaluate the relationship
between judicial reform and innovation of private listed firms in China using the transformation of judi-
cial decentralization and administration: inter-provincial circuit tribunals. Results find that the coverage
of circuit tribunals improves the innovation output and innovation quality of private-controlled listed
firms. Additionally, the legal system affects firms’ incentives to innovate by increasing their likelihood
of obtaining long-term bank loans and mortgages and enhancing their risk-taking capacity. The positive
correlation is more pronounced among firms with weaker political ties, farther from the geographical
radius of the SPC, and in a less segmented market environment. Our findings provide implications for
judicial independence transformation and corporate innovation incentive policy.
